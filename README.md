# Library-Research-Internship-25
After completing the Advanced Master's in Digital Humanities at KU Leuven, I began an internship with the Special Collections unit of KU Leuven's Central Library Services. The internship focused on supporting a project centered around the extant letters of 16th-century humanist Frans Cranevelt. This repository contains a selection of project data, along with the slides from my presentation at the international conference _New Perspectives on Neo-Latin Correspondences during the Early Modern Period_ in Louvain-la-Neuve. Information incomplete for now, but the final repository will be published on here by the end of June, 2025.
